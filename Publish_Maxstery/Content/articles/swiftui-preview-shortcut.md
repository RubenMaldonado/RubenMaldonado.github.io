# Resume SwiftUI Preview with the Keyboard

I'm still learning my ropes with Xcode IDE and SwiftUI programming in general. One issue that I found quickly is that when you make any significant change in the structure or your views, the preview canvas stops reflecting your changes automatically. The solution is to move your hands off the keyboard, take your mouse and click the "resume" or "try again" button. This takes several seconds that I wanted to save so I finally found the proper keyboard shortcut.

```
Option + Command + P

```

Was hard to remmember at the beginning but it really save a few seconds each time that is needed.
