# Toggling between different windows in Xcode

I'm still learning my ropes with Xcode IDE and Mac OS in general. In windows, you normally can switch between instances of the same app just by doing CTRL + Tab, or you can see the different icons in your menu. macOS works a little bit differently, when you have multiple windows of the same app you only see the last one that you opened after you click the icon in your dock. Until today my process was to perform a right-click in the icon and select the windows that were hidden or that I wanted to show. But as usual, this was a complete waste of time, so I finally spend 3 minutes on google finding a solution, and a simple keyboard shortcut was the solution.



```
Command + `

```

Saving seconds every day, happy codding!
